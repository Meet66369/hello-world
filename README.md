# My Web Design Goals
As I dive into the world of web design, my goal is pretty straightforward but ambitious. I want to get really good at the basics â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the building blocks of the web, and I believe a strong foundation in them is crucial. But it's not just about code. I'm keen on learning how to make websites that not only work well but also look great and provide a fantastic user experience. I'm excited about exploring different design trends, figuring out what makes a website truly engaging, and how to create designs that are both eye-catching and easy to navigate. Down the line, I hope to blend creativity with functionality, making websites that stand out and meet users' needs in this fast-paced digital world.
